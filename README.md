# dIOS

dIOS is a patch tool (Windows only at the moment) which makes your Dolphin Emulator more like a real Wii NAND.
This does NOT help you if the homebrew app has Anti-Emulator code in it (HackMii Installer for example)

This should NOT replace your installed titles but PLEASE PLEASE # PLEASE back up your titles and your Dolphin NAND.

If there's no Wii System Menu installed in Dolphin, it will automatically download and install 4.1U and custom IOS titles.

* IOS37 has been Trucha Bug patched.

* Homebrew Channel preinstalled if it isn't already installed in the NAND. This is not normally able to boot so if it boots, you did it right *
